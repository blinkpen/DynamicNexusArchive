      <h2>Library of Aeons</h2>
      <p>Welcome to the mythic vault. This chamber holds the archetypal frameworks, symbolic systems, and metaphysical blueprints that shape consciousness across time. Each entry is a lens—each lens a key.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="aeon-scroll"><h3>🌿 Elemental Harmony</h3><p>Earth, Air, Fire, Water, and Æther—five forces in dynamic balance. Elemental harmony is the foundation of ritual, healing, and energetic design.</p></section>
    <section class="aeon-scroll"><h3>🌠 Astrology</h3><p>Celestial bodies as archetypal mirrors. Astrology maps the soul’s journey through planetary rhythms and cosmic timing.</p></section>
    <section class="aeon-scroll"><h3>🔢 Numerology</h3><p>Numbers as vibrational codes. Each digit carries symbolic weight, revealing patterns in names, dates, and destiny.</p></section>
    <section class="aeon-scroll"><h3>🔺 Sacred Geometry</h3><p>Shapes as portals. Geometry encodes universal truths—spirals, platonic solids, and fractals as blueprints of creation.</p></section>
    <section class="aeon-scroll"><h3>📐 The Golden Ratio</h3><p>Phi: the divine proportion. Found in nature, art, and architecture, it reflects aesthetic harmony and organic growth.</p></section>
    <section class="aeon-scroll"><h3>⏳ Eternalism</h3><p>All moments exist simultaneously. Past, present, and future are layers—not linear steps. Time is a field, not a line.</p></section>
    <section class="aeon-scroll"><h3>🧬 Panpsychism</h3><p>Consciousness is everywhere. Every particle, plant, and planet holds awareness. Mind is not limited to biology.</p></section>
    <section class="aeon-scroll"><h3>🌍 Pantheism</h3><p>All is divine. Pantheism sees the universe itself as God—every star, stone, and soul as sacred expression. There is no separation between creator and creation.</p></section>
    <section class="aeon-scroll"><h3>🌌 Panentheism</h3><p>God is both within and beyond. Panentheism holds that the divine permeates all things, yet also transcends them. The cosmos is a vessel, but not the whole.</p></section>
    <section class="aeon-scroll"><h3>🧠 Abstract vs Linguistic Thought</h3><p>Abstract thought moves in symbols, images, and intuition. Linguistic thought relies on structured language. Both shape reality—one through feeling, one through form.</p></section>
    <section class="aeon-scroll"><h3>🧭 Hardwired Spirituality Function</h3><p>The human nervous system is tuned for transcendence. Ritual, awe, and altered states are not anomalies—they are built-in pathways.</p></section>
    <section class="aeon-scroll"><h3>🕊️ Prototheism</h3><p>Before gods, there was pattern. Prototheism explores pre-deific intelligence—laws, forces, and archetypes that precede personified divinity.</p></section>
    <section class="aeon-scroll"><h3>👁️ The Third Eye</h3><p>Inner vision, symbolic sight. The third eye perceives subtle realms, archetypes, and energetic truth beyond the physical.</p></section>
    <section class="aeon-scroll"><h3>📜 The Akashic Records</h3><p>The universal memory field. Every thought, event, and soul imprint is stored in the Akasha—accessible through deep trance, intention, and resonance.</p></section>

      <h3>🌀 Closing Reflection</h3>
      <p><i>These scrolls are not static—they evolve as you do. Return often. Read between the lines. The Library of Aeons is a living archive, and you are its reader, its writer, and its key.</i></p>
