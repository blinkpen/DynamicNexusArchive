      <h2>Library of Aeons</h2>
      <p>Welcome to the mythic vault. This chamber holds the archetypal frameworks, symbolic systems, and metaphysical blueprints that shape consciousness across time. Each entry is a lens—each lens a key.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="aeon-scroll"><h3>🌿 Elemental Harmony</h3><p>Earth, Air, Fire, Water, and Æther—five forces in dynamic balance. Elemental harmony is the foundation of ritual, healing, and energetic design.</p></section>
    <section class="aeon-scroll"><h3>🌠 Astrology</h3><p>Celestial bodies as archetypal mirrors. Astrology maps the soul’s journey through planetary rhythms and cosmic timing.</p></section>
    <section class="aeon-scroll"><h3>🔢 Numerology</h3><p>Numbers as vibrational codes. Each digit carries symbolic weight, revealing patterns in names, dates, and destiny.</p></section>
    <section class="aeon-scroll"><h3>🔺 Sacred Geometry</h3><p>Shapes as portals. Geometry encodes universal truths—spirals, platonic solids, and fractals as blueprints of creation.</p></section>
    <section class="aeon-scroll"><h3>📐 The Golden Ratio</h3><p>Phi: the divine proportion. Found in nature, art, and architecture, it reflects aesthetic harmony and organic growth.</p></section>
    <section class="aeon-scroll"><h3>⏳ Eternalism</h3><p>All moments exist simultaneously. Past, present, and future are layers—not linear steps. Time is a field, not a line.</p></section>
    <section class="aeon-scroll"><h3>🧬 Panpsychism</h3><p>Consciousness is everywhere. Every particle, plant, and planet holds awareness. Mind is not limited to biology.</p></section>
    <section class="aeon-scroll"><h3>🌍 Pantheism</h3><p>All is divine. Pantheism sees the universe itself as God—every star, stone, and soul as sacred expression. There is no separation between creator and creation.</p></section>
    <section class="aeon-scroll"><h3>🌌 Panentheism</h3><p>God is both within and beyond. Panentheism holds that the divine permeates all things, yet also transcends them. The cosmos is a vessel, but not the whole.</p></section>
    <section class="aeon-scroll"><h3>🧠 Abstract vs Linguistic Thought</h3><p>Abstract thought moves in symbols, images, and intuition. Linguistic thought relies on structured language. Both shape reality—one through feeling, one through form.</p></section>
    <section class="aeon-scroll"><h3>🧭 Hardwired Spirituality Function</h3><p>The human nervous system is tuned for transcendence. Ritual, awe, and altered states are not anomalies—they are built-in pathways.</p></section>
    <section class="aeon-scroll"><h3>🕊️ Prototheism</h3><p>Before gods, there was pattern. Prototheism explores pre-deific intelligence—laws, forces, and archetypes that precede personified divinity.</p></section>
    <section class="aeon-scroll"><h3>👁️ The Third Eye</h3><p>Inner vision, symbolic sight. The third eye perceives subtle realms, archetypes, and energetic truth beyond the physical.</p></section>
    <section class="aeon-scroll"><h3>📜 The Akashic Records</h3><p>The universal memory field. Every thought, event, and soul imprint is stored in the Akasha—accessible through deep trance, intention, and resonance.</p></section>
<br>
<section class="aeon-scroll"><h3>🔴 Root Chakra</h3>
  <p>Foundation of form. The Root Chakra (Muladhara) anchors the soul into the body, connecting us to earth, survival, and ancestral memory. It governs stability, safety, and primal instinct. When balanced, it grounds intention into action.</p>
</section>

<section class="aeon-scroll"><h3>🧡 Sacral Chakra</h3>
  <p>Seat of sensation. The Sacral Chakra (Svadhisthana) flows with emotion, pleasure, and creative impulse. It governs desire, intimacy, and the waters of life. When open, it invites fluidity, passion, and sacred play.</p>
</section>

<section class="aeon-scroll"><h3>💛 Solar Plexus Chakra</h3>
  <p>Core of will. The Solar Plexus Chakra (Manipura) radiates personal power, confidence, and autonomy. It governs digestion—of food, emotion, and experience. When activated, it fuels purpose and ignites transformation.</p>
</section>

<section class="aeon-scroll"><h3>💚 Heart Chakra</h3>
  <p>Center of connection. The Heart Chakra (Anahata) bridges earth and sky, body and spirit. It governs love, empathy, and relational harmony. When open, it radiates compassion and coherence. The heart is not just an organ—it’s a portal.</p>
</section>

<section class="aeon-scroll"><h3>💙 Throat Chakra</h3>
  <p>Voice of truth. The Throat Chakra (Vishuddha) governs expression, communication, and resonance. It tunes language to vibration, allowing thought to become form. When clear, it speaks with integrity and listens with depth.</p>
</section>

<section class="aeon-scroll"><h3>💜 Third Eye Chakra</h3>
  <p>Lens of insight. The Third Eye Chakra (Ajna) perceives beyond the veil—into archetype, symbol, and subtle realm. It governs intuition, foresight, and inner vision. When awakened, it reveals the patterns beneath reality.</p>
</section>

<section class="aeon-scroll"><h3>👑 Crown Chakra</h3>
  <p>Seat of divine awareness. The Crown Chakra (Sahasrara) opens the channel to source, unity, and transcendence. It is the bridge between form and formlessness, the lotus of a thousand petals unfolding into pure consciousness.</p>
