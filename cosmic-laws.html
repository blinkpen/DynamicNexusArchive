      <h2>Cosmic Laws</h2>
      <p>These are the foundational harmonics of reality—laws that govern all planes, all beings, all timelines. They are not commandments, but currents. To know them is to navigate the multiverse with clarity and grace.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="cosmic-law"><h3>🌐 Law of Divine Unity</h3><p>All is one. Every particle, person, and plane is interconnected. Separation is illusion; unity is the underlying truth.</p></section>
    <section class="cosmic-law"><h3>🧠 Law of Mentalism</h3><p>All is mind. Consciousness precedes form. The universe is a mental construct shaped by thought and awareness.</p></section>
    <section class="cosmic-law"><h3>🎵 Law of Vibration</h3><p>Everything moves, everything vibrates. Frequency determines form, emotion, and experience.</p></section>
    <section class="cosmic-law"><h3>🔁 Law of Correspondence</h3><p>As above, so below. As within, so without. Patterns repeat across scales and dimensions.</p></section>
    <section class="cosmic-law"><h3>⚖️ Law of Polarity</h3><p>Everything has its opposite. Light and dark, joy and sorrow—each defines and completes the other.</p></section>
    <section class="cosmic-law"><h3>⚧️ Law of Gender</h3><p>Masculine and feminine energies exist in all things. Creation requires balance and interplay between these forces.</p></section>
    <section class="cosmic-law"><h3>🌊 Law of Rhythm</h3><p>All flows in cycles. Expansion and contraction, inhale and exhale—rhythm governs movement and change.</p></section>
    <section class="cosmic-law"><h3>🔥 Law of Causality</h3><p>Every action has a reaction. Cause and effect ripple through time and space, shaping outcomes.</p></section>
    <section class="cosmic-law"><h3>🌀 Law of Relativity</h3><p>All truths are contextual. Meaning arises through comparison, contrast, and perspective.</p></section>
    <section class="cosmic-law"><h3>⚖️ Law of Balance</h3><p>Equilibrium is the natural state. When extremes arise, the universe seeks restoration.</p></section>
    <section class="cosmic-law"><h3>💰 Law of Compensation</h3><p>Energy given is energy returned. Every gift, sacrifice, or effort finds its echo.</p></section>
    <section class="cosmic-law"><h3>🎶 Law of Resonance</h3><p>Like attracts like. Vibrations harmonize with matching frequencies, drawing similar energies together.</p></section>
    <section class="cosmic-law"><h3>🌟 Law of Attraction</h3><p>Focused thought magnetizes reality. What you dwell on, you draw toward you.</p></section>
    <section class="cosmic-law"><h3>🔄 Law of Perpetual Transmutation</h3><p>Energy is always in motion. Lower frequencies can be elevated; stagnation can be transformed.</p></section>

    <section class="reflection">
      <h3>📜 Closing Reflection</h3>
      <p>These laws are not static—they are alive. Study them, feel them, apply them. Let them tune your awareness and guide your path through the multidimensional weave.</p>
